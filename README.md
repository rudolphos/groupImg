# groupImg

A python script to organize your images by similarity.

It uses a [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm to separatem them in clusters.

Watch it working below.

## Why ?

It was about one year since I made the switch from Windows to Linux, and I wanted to get better at the terminal. I always thought it was cool to master it. To make a long story short, one day I did mount a linux image on my external backup drive instead of the pen drive. Some basic */dev/sd\** confusion. Anyway's, I overwrited all my photos; so I used [Foremost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foremost_(software)) (which is a great tool) to recover them. It recovered 350.000 images; miniatures, textures, profile pictures, wallpapers... and among all that my personal photos. So I wrote a little script to divide the images in folders, 1000 images per folder, if I'm not mistaken. I went through all the folders separating my photos from the random images that weren't important. To end the story, I came up with this script to "cluster" the photos by similiraty and makes things a little easier for me.

## How to use

Navigate to the folder you want. CLI - Command Line Interface or GUI - Graphic User Interface

Install the requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### CLI

Call the script passing the image folder you want to organize.

```
python groupimg.py -f /home/user/Pictures/
```

## Parameters

\ `-f` folder where your images are (use absolute path).
Example: ```groupimg -f /home/user/Pictures```

\ `-k` number of folders you want to separate your images. 
Example: ```groupimg -f /home/user/Pictures -k 5```

\ `-r` size to resample the image by. Default is 128. Range should be a value between 16 and 256.

\ `-m` if you want to move your images instead of just copy them.

\ `-s` if you want the algorithm to consider the size of the images as a feature.

### GUI

![groupImgGUI](screenshot-GUI.png)

Just call the groupImgGUI.py file.

```
python groupImgGUI.py
```

Click the button Select folder to select the folder with the pictures you want to organize.

You can adjust the settings by checking the settings box.

 - **N. Group** - How many groups should the images be separated in.
 - **Resample** - Size to resample the image before comparing (small sizes
   gives fast results).
 - **Move** - Move the images instead of copy them (useful if you have low
   space on your hard drive).
 - **Size** - Consider the size of the images to organize them (useful if
   you want to separate thumbnails from real pictures).
